A jQuery (tested with 1.4.2) plugin that allows fading of pages in a unique way. 

How to use? In its most simple form:

	$(document).ready(function(){
		$('#nav').epicFade();
	});

Options
	landingPage (id of the page to show when page loads, default is the first link found)
	notPage (anything inside the page container you don't want to be considered a page, default is '.clear')
	
Syntax for links and pages:
	<a href="#X" id="X">Y</a>
	<div id="page-X">Z</div>
	
	X = page id, Y = link text, Z = page content
